# CodingEventsJava 
Purpose of the app: This app is designed to display event information for user-created coding events. 

Current State of the app: App has an operational webpage with a persistent database behind it storing information. Events, event details, and event category are the three elements currently populating the site. Both Events and Categories can be displayed, added, or deleted. 

Future Improvements: A Person class, which will store user info, preferences, and hopefully a calendar showing the dates of future events the user is interested in attending. I would also like to see events broken down further by their specific fields (front-end, Java, etc.) so that users could specify which kinds of events they may be interested in.
